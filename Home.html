			<h2>Programming in C</h2>
			I wrote a lot in C my dude. Like a lot. Well for a student it was a lot. I wrote a compiler and got
			myself a stuffed dinosaur, you jelly?</br>

			<h2>Programming in Java</h2>
			To be honest this is my strong language. I've been using it for around 5 years now. Learned to code with it 
			and while I know it's got some issues. It's still a fun language to write programs with. Check out my calculator 
			on GitHub I made in Java or the android projects, they're in Java too.</br>

			<h2>Android Studio</h2>
			I've built a few games in android studio. Platformer, flappy bird, and asteroid style stuff. Check out my GitHub
			I've got more on it there.</br>

			<h2>Web Building</h2>
			Well I mean come on. I've clearly done something. What do you think your reading this on? or maybe you just really hate 
			it that much... alright fine don't hire me then, see if I care!</br>
